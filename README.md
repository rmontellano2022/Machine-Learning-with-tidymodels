# Machine Learning with Tidymodels 

This is the repository for D-Lab's Machine Learning with Tidymodels. Laptop, Internet connection, and Zoom account required.

This is [Jae Yeon Kim](https://jaeyk.github.io/)'s remix version of the [D-Labâ€™s Introduction to Machine Learning in R workshop](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Machine-Learning-in-R) designed by [Chris Kennedy](https://ck37.com/) and [Evan Muzzall](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/people/evan-muzzall). This version of the workshop focuses on [the tidymodels framework](https://www.tidymodels.org/) and its applications.

**Prior experience with R is assumed such as R-Fundamentals Parts 1 through 4 or equivalent knowledge.**
**Statistical concepts such as mean and standard deviation necessary**

# Workshop Goals

# About the UC Berkeley D-Lab

D-Lab works with Berkeley faculty, research staff, and students to advance data-intensive social science and humanities research. Our goal at D-Lab is to provide practical training, staff support, resources, and space to enable you to use R for your own research applications. Our services cater to all skill levels and no programming, statistical, or computer science backgrounds are necessary. We offer these services in the form of workshops such as R Fundamentals, one-to-one consulting, and working groups that cover a variety of research topics, digital tools, and programming languages.  

Visit the [D-Lab homepage](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/) to learn more about us. View our [calendar](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/calendar-node-field-date) for upcoming events, and also learn about how to utilize our [consulting](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/consulting) and [data](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/data-resources) services.
